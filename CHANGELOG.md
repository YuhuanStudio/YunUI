# Changelog

All notable changes to `@yuhuanowo/yunui` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor = features,
patch = fixes, anything may change between 0.x releases).

> **Cadence:** we deliberately stay on `0.2.x` for a long run — releases are
> almost always **patch** bumps. A `0.3.0` / `1.0.0` bump needs explicit owner
> sign-off. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#versioning-policy).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`MediaGallery` grid hover actions were near-invisible, and images had no
  built-in zoom.** The download/delete controls used page-level outline button
  variants (`primary` = near-black icon on a transparent fill, `destructive` =
  coral outline) rendered on top of the image + hover scrim, so they read as
  empty outlines with no visible glyph. They are now solid, theme-aware circular
  controls (card fill + ring + shadow, foreground/error icon) that stay legible
  on any image in light and dark. Completed images are also click-to-zoom by
  default via the **same `ImageLightbox`** that `ContentImage` uses (zoom /
  rotate / download / keyboard); a host `onPreview` still overrides it.
- **`ModelManagerCard` no longer looks top-heavy when it has actions but no
  row-select control.** The top control bar (`min-h-7 mb-3`) rendered whenever
  `selectSlot` OR `actions` existed, so a card with only `actions` (no
  multi-select checkbox) floated the action button alone top-right above a dead
  band, with the icon/name pushed to a second row. The bar now renders only for
  `selectSlot`; without it the actions ride on the identity row (right-aligned,
  aligned with the name). Multi-select admin mode (with `selectSlot`) is
  unchanged.
- **`Sheet` body now has default padding (`px-5 py-4`, matching its header).**
  Without it every consumer's sheet content sat flush against the panel edges
  (e.g. settings drawers with sliders touching the border).
- **`ThemeToggle` pill no longer shows a lopsided blank stretch in dark mode.**
  The Sun stayed in-flow while `scale-0` (still occupying layout) and the Moon
  was absolutely positioned against the button, so dark mode rendered the icon
  off-center beside an empty slot. Both icons now stack in one 14px slot; the
  pre-mount skeleton also shrank from `w-16` to the trigger's real footprint.
- **`TabsList` gained `max-w-full`** — as an `inline-flex` it sized to content,
  so a long tab strip dragged the page sideways on narrow screens instead of
  engaging its own `overflow-x-auto`.
- **Scrollbar thumb is token-based** (`--border-default`, hover
  `--border-strong`) instead of black-alpha, which was invisible on dark and
  true-black backgrounds.
- **Dark-mode readability of the shadcn `muted` bridge.** `--color-muted-foreground`
  and the `.text-label` utility mapped to `--text-muted` (#52525b in dark) —
  only 2.57:1, so every consumer label/caption/section-header that used
  `text-muted-foreground` (the shadcn convention for readable secondary text)
  washed out. Both now map to `--text-tertiary` (#71717a, ~4:1). Light mode is
  unchanged (its `--text-muted` already equals `--text-tertiary`). Fixes the
  app-wide "washed-out details" seen across consumer surfaces.
- **`Gauge` / `Slider` tracks were invisible in dark mode.** Both used
  `--color-muted` (= `--bg-elevated`) for the unfilled track, which blends into
  dark cards — the gauge ring and slider trough effectively disappeared. Now use
  `--color-border`.
- **`Slider` thumb no longer clips at the track extremes.** The Root gained
  `px-2.5` (half the 20px thumb) so a thumb at min/max stays inside its box
  instead of overflowing/clipping past the panel edge — very visible in narrow
  containers (e.g. a settings drawer on mobile).
- **`TabsTrigger` icon + label spacing.** Added `gap-1.5` so an icon child no
  longer sits flush against the label text.

### Changed
- **Content + chat stacks fully restyled in YunUI's flat design vocabulary.**
  Follow-up to the earlier token pass: every `src/content/*` and `src/chat/*`
  component now uses the flat design tokens and class API that the rest of YunUI
  (patterns / ai) uses — `--bg-elevated` / `--bg-card` / `--border-hairline` /
  `--border-default` / `--text-primary·secondary·tertiary` / `--accent` and the
  `.card` / `.badge` / `*-soft` classes — instead of the shadcn `@theme` aliases
  (`bg-muted` / `border-border` / `text-muted-foreground` / `bg-primary`) it was
  lifted from Agent with. This guarantees the content/chat surfaces match YunUI
  even inside consumer apps that define their own shadcn tokens.
- **`CodeBlock` rewritten to YunUI's original code-block design** — the `.card`
  container, window-chrome traffic-light dots, a language `.badge`,
  `--bg-elevated` header / `--bg-base` body and `--accent-subtle` hover buttons,
  matching `patterns/CodeBlock` (keeps Shiki highlighting). Was a divergent
  terminal-header design lifted from Agent.
- **`MarkdownRenderer` root is `not-prose`** — it styles every element itself, so
  a host `.prose` (Tailwind Typography) was double-styling the output (a second
  table frame + dead margins, shoved callout titles, code that looked different
  inside vs outside prose). The custom component map is now the single source of
  truth, immune to host prose.
- **Markdown links carry a persistent underline** (subtle `--border-default`,
  darkening on hover) so links read as links, not body text.
- **Content stack now speaks YunUI's design language.** `CalloutBlock` maps its
  GitHub admonition tones onto the semantic token utilities (`bg-info-soft` /
  `text-success` / `border-error-soft`, "important" → accent tokens) instead of
  hard-coded palette colors, so callouts re-theme with the design system.
  `CodeBlock` and `MarkdownRenderer` drop raw `bg-[#f6f8fa]` / `bg-green-100` /
  `bg-yellow-200` for `bg-muted` / `bg-success-soft` / `bg-warning-soft`.

### Fixed
- **Markdown callouts (`> [!NOTE]`) rendered as a raw blockquote** with the
  marker text showing — react-markdown emits a leading `"\n"` text node so the
  paragraph was never the first child. The blockquote handler now finds the first
  real element and preserves inline nodes, so callouts become `CalloutBlock`
  (which composes `Alert`).
- **Shiki code was double-spaced** — block `.line` spans separated by literal
  `"\n"` text nodes rendered an extra empty line under `white-space: pre`.
  `content.css` collapses the inter-line newlines while each `.line` keeps `pre`.
- **Emphasized code lines (`highlightLines`) were clipped and off-brand** — the
  highlight used indigo and, on horizontal scroll, only spanned the visible width
  (cutting mid-token). Now tinted with the host `--accent` (indigo fallback) and
  `code` is sized to its widest line so the highlight covers the whole row.
- **Task-list checkboxes rendered browser-grey** — a native checkbox tick is
  colored by CSS `accent-color`, not `text-*`; switched to `accent-(--accent)`.
- **Code blocks drew a nested "box-in-box"** — a leaked host/prose `code` style
  (border + radius + chip background) bled into Shiki's `<code>`. `content.css`
  now neutralizes it, so code sits flat on one clean surface.
- **Touch a11y** — code-block copy/edit buttons and `ChatMessage` hover actions
  were `opacity-0 group-hover` (invisible/unreachable on touch); now visible on
  coarse pointers (`opacity-100 md:opacity-0 md:group-hover:opacity-100`).
- **iOS focus-zoom** — `ChatComposer`'s textarea was `text-sm` (<16px); now
  `text-base md:text-sm` so mobile Safari doesn't zoom on focus.
- Aligned content surfaces to YunUI's radius language (`rounded-lg`→`rounded-xl`
  on callouts, code blocks, tables, details, mermaid, images), the composer focus
  state to the ring convention, and the last raw colors (`border-gray-300`,
  `bg-destructive/10`) to semantic utilities.
- **Content stack infinite render loop** — `MermaidDiagram` (stuck on
  "Rendering diagram…") and `MathRenderer` (CPU thrash) looped forever because
  `useContentT()` and the default adapter's `useT` returned a fresh function on
  every render, which was in those components' effect deps. `useT`/`useContentT`
  now return stable references, and the async effects no longer depend on the
  translator. Only surfaced under real rendering — caught by screenshot QA.
- **`ChatMessage` header collided badges with the timestamp on narrow widths** —
  a `flex items-center` header meant wrapping badges (e.g. a model chip plus a
  `GenerationStats` token/throughput/latency row) overlapped the right-aligned
  timestamp on mobile. The header now aligns to the top, wraps the name/badges
  group, and keeps the timestamp on the first line — clean at every width.
- **`ContentImage` spun forever when a `ChatMessageList` shared the page** — the
  lazy-load `IntersectionObserver` rooted itself at the first
  `[data-scroll-container="true"]` element (which `ChatMessageList` sets). If the
  image sat *outside* that list (the normal content + chat page), it never
  intersected, so the `src` was never assigned and the spinner never resolved.
  The observer now only uses that container as root when it actually contains the
  image, else falls back to the viewport. Caught by screenshot QA on the showcase.

### Added
- **`MermaidDiagram` is hand-drawn (Excalidraw-style) for every diagram type.**
  Uses Mermaid 11's native `look: "handDrawn"` for the types it supports
  (flowchart, state, class, ER…) and, for the ones it leaves straight (sequence,
  gantt, pie, journey, gitGraph, timeline, mindmap…), post-processes the SVG with
  a turbulence-displacement filter applied to strokes/shapes only (text stays
  crisp), so all diagrams read as a sketch.
- **`MermaidDiagram` click-to-zoom** — new `enableZoom` (default `true`) opens the
  diagram in a full-screen lightbox on a theme-matched panel (readable in light
  and dark). `ImageLightbox` now accepts arbitrary `children` (not just an
  `<img src>`), so any inline SVG can reuse its zoom/rotate/close controls.
- **Localizable labels for the last hardcoded strings** — `AreaChart`
  `noDataLabel`, `AudioPlayer` `labels` (play/pause/seek/download aria), and
  `ChatComposer` `sendLabel` / `stopLabel`, so every user-facing string in the
  new components is host-overridable.
- **`ChatComposer` `allowSendEmpty`** — allow sending with an empty textarea
  (e.g. when attachments alone form a valid message).
- **`ScrollArea` / `ScrollBar` (primitives)** — a styled, cross-browser custom
  scrollbar around any overflowing content (Radix-based). Adds
  `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`.
- **`Card` sub-components** — `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`,
  `CardContent`, `CardFooter` for composing structured cards (previously `Card`
  was a single container).

### Docs / site
- **Showcase Content + Chat sections are now localized.** They were the only
  sections with hardcoded English section/demo titles + descriptions and nav
  labels; every string now flows through the `showcase` message namespace
  (en / zh-CN / zh-TW), matching every other section.
- **Showcase gained the missing demos** — a `GenerationStats` metric row in the
  chat assistant message (tokens / throughput / latency, beside the model badge)
  and a standalone `ContentImage` (a self-contained local SVG scene, so the
  lazy-loaded, click-to-zoom frame always renders without an external fetch).
- **SegmentedBar docs page no longer 500s** — its "Total and remainder" demo
  passed a live `formatValue` function inline from the (server-rendered) MDX,
  which React Server Components reject. Moved to a client demo component
  (`SegmentedBarLegendDemo`), matching the AreaChart pattern.
- **`Select` parts** — `SelectLabel`, `SelectSeparator`, `SelectScrollUpButton`,
  `SelectScrollDownButton` (round out the Radix Select surface).
- **`PopoverAnchor`** — position a Popover relative to a separate anchor element.
- **`Badge` structural variants** — `secondary`, `outline`, and `destructive`
  (alias of `error`) alongside the existing semantic variants, for
  shadcn-style call sites.
- **`@yuhuanowo/yunui/content` (new subpath) — the content-rendering stack.**
  Rich rendering for LLM/chat/doc content, extracted from the Agent (garvea)
  project (the most complete of our three apps) so all of them share one
  canonical implementation: `MarkdownRenderer` (GFM tables/task-lists, KaTeX
  math, Shiki code, Mermaid diagrams, GitHub-style callouts, heading anchors,
  lazy zoomable images), plus standalone `CodeBlock`/`InlineCode` (Shiki),
  `CalloutBlock`, `MathRenderer`/`InlineMath`/`BlockMath`, `MermaidDiagram`,
  `ContentImage` and `ImageLightbox`. Decoupled via props: `urlTransform`
  (rewrite image/link URLs) and `onCodeEdit` (open code in an editor). The heavy
  engines are **optional `peerDependencies`** (`react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`,
  `remark-math`, `rehype-raw`/`-katex`/`-slug`, `katex`, `shiki`, `mermaid`) and
  Shiki/Mermaid load on demand, so `content.js` itself stays ~36 KB. Ships
  `@yuhuanowo/yunui/content.css`; consumers also import `katex/dist/katex.min.css`.
- **`@yuhuanowo/yunui/chat` (new subpath) — the chat pattern.** Presentational,
  slot-based building blocks for AI chat UIs (no data/model types, no i18n):
  `ChatMessage` (avatar + header/badges + body + footer + hover actions),
  `ChatMessageList` (smart stick-to-bottom scroller), `ChatComposer`
  (auto-growing textarea, Enter-to-send, send/stop, attachment + toolbar slots)
  and `ChatHeader` (backdrop-blur shell with slots). Pairs with
  `@yuhuanowo/yunui/content`. No new dependencies.
- **`AreaChart` (primitive)** — an interactive line/area chart for a time series:
  smooth bezier curve, gradient area fill, dashed grid, and a hover guide with a
  value tooltip. Container-width (ResizeObserver), pure SVG. The "full" chart
  counterpart to `Sparkline`. Extracted from Yunxin's analytics charts so both
  apps (and Yunshu) share one canonical chart.
- **`Sparkline` (primitive)** — a tiny inline SVG line/area chart for a single
  number series (throughput, GPU utilization, latency), tone-colored and
  container-width. No chart library.
- **`Gauge` (primitive)** — a circular 0–100 percentage ring with a centered
  value or custom label; the arc color follows a semantic `tone`.
- **`SegmentedBar` (primitive)** — a proportional multi-segment bar toward a
  `total` (memory allocation, request mix) with an optional value legend.
  Complements `MetricBar`'s single fill.
- **`FileDropzone` (primitive)** — a drag-and-drop / click-to-browse upload
  target that reports files via `onFiles`; presentation + interaction only.
- **`AudioPlayer` (patterns)** — a compact controls bar around an HTML5
  `<audio>`: play/pause, seek, time, and an optional download button.
- **`MediaGallery` (patterns)** — one canonical result surface for generation
  pages: a grid/list of media results (image · video · audio) with per-item
  status (pending/processing/completed/failed), a progress bar, signed-URL
  expiry detection, and hover download/delete/preview. Extracted so Yunxin's
  image/video/audio galleries and Yunshu's generation pages share one component.
- Full docs (3 locales), showcase demos and prop tables for all of the above.
  Motivated by the Yunshu webui rewrite onto YunUI and the tri-repo unification.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`PageLayout` (patterns)** — the standard full-height page shell: a navbar slot,
  a `flex-1` `<main>` offset (`pt-28`) to clear the fixed navbar, and a footer slot.
  Navbar/footer are passed as slots so the shell stays decoupled from their props;
  `hideFooter`, `transparentBg` and `mainClassName` cover the common variations.
  Extracted from Yunxin's hand-rolled shell (used by 8+ marketing pages).
- **Original OKLCH palette system — 24 palettes.** The design-token scheme layer is
  now generated from an in-house OKLCH model (`scripts/gen-tokens.mjs`) with
  perceptually-even ramps; added `teal`, `lime`, `amber`, `plum` and `fuchsia` (19 →
  24). The brand/accent/neutral roles can target any of them at runtime.
- **`YUNUI_THEME_PRESETS` — 12 curated multi-color themes.** Named
  `{brand, accent, neutral}` combos (Aurora, Sunset, Forest, Ocean, Grape, Ember,
  Lagoon, Blossom, Royal, Citrus, Orchid, Mono), exported with
  `YunUIThemePreset` / `YunUIThemePresetName`. Apply with `applyTheme(preset)`.
- **Theme-effect utilities** (in the stylesheet, token-driven so they restyle with
  the active brand/accent): `.bg-brand-gradient`, `.text-brand-gradient`,
  `.glow-brand`, `.glow-accent`, `.bg-brand-sheen`.

### Fixed
- **iOS Safari no longer zooms the page when focusing a field.** Mobile Safari
  auto-zooms when a focused input/textarea/select has font-size < 16px (our fields
  use `text-sm` = 14px). Added a touch-only (`hover:none` + `pointer:coarse`) rule
  flooring form fields at 16px; desktop keeps the 14px look. Verified in WebKit and
  Chromium under iPhone emulation.
- **Escape closes the `LanguageSwitcher` / `ThemeToggle` dropdowns (cross-browser).**
  They previously only closed on outside-click. Added Escape-to-close with focus
  return to the trigger — via a **document-level** listener, because WebKit/Safari
  on macOS doesn't focus a `<button>` on click, so a container `onKeyDown` would
  never receive the key (caught by testing in the WebKit engine). `CustomSelect`
  now focuses its trigger on mouse-open for the same reason, so its keyboard nav
  works in Safari too.
- **`Combobox` is keyboard-navigable.** Added ArrowUp/Down/Home/End/Enter listbox
  navigation, `role="listbox"`/`role="option"`/`aria-selected`, and
  `aria-activedescendant` — previously mouse-only.
- **Accessible names + ARIA on the dropdowns.** `aria-label` on the `ModelSelect` /
  `CustomSelect` / `Combobox` / `SearchInput` search fields (placeholder alone isn't
  a label); `aria-expanded`/`aria-haspopup` on the `ThemeToggle` trigger; the Navbar
  mobile-menu scrim is `aria-hidden`.
- **Navbar respects the iPhone safe area.** The fixed top bar uses
  `max(1.5rem, env(safe-area-inset-top))` so it clears the notch / Dynamic Island in
  standalone Safari (no change on desktop, where the inset is 0).
- **Horizontal scroll bars no longer scroll vertically on touch.** `overflow-x-auto`
  with the default `overflow-y: visible` makes a browser compute `overflow-y` to
  `auto` too, so the `ModelSelect` provider-filter row (and the `NavTabs` / `Tabs`
  bars) could be dragged up/down a few px on a phone. Added explicit
  `overflow-y-hidden overscroll-x-contain` to those single-row scrollers.
- **Unbreakable text no longer widens its row/card.** Added `truncate` to the
  `LinkRow` title, `SessionItem` detail, `ModelCard` developer label and the
  `Navbar` app name (with `min-w-0` on the logo link), so long ids / device strings
  / brand names ellipsize instead of pushing the layout past the viewport.
- **Hand-rolled dropdown panels stay inside the viewport.** `ModelSelect`,
  `CustomSelect`, `Combobox`, `LanguageSwitcher` and `ThemeToggle` positioned
  their floating panel with a plain `absolute` and no collision handling, so on
  narrow / mobile screens the panel (notably `ModelSelect`'s fixed `w-96`) spilled
  off the right edge and could run past the bottom. New `useAnchoredPosition` hook
  measures each panel against the viewport and applies a horizontal `marginLeft`
  nudge (margin, so it never fights framer-motion / `animate-in` transforms) plus a
  `maxHeight` cap paired with an internal `flex-1 min-h-0` scroll region. The Radix
  panels (`Select`, `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`) already flip/shift via Popper and are
  unchanged.

### Changed
- **All dropdown / select panels share the LanguageSwitcher look.** Unified every
  floating menu panel onto one chrome — `rounded-2xl border border-border
  bg-background/60 backdrop-blur-2xl shadow-lg shadow-black/5` — across `Select`,
  `CustomSelect`, `Combobox`, `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `ModelSelect` and the
  `Navbar` mobile menu (they previously diverged: square `rounded-xl`, opaque
  `bg-(--bg-elevated)` / `bg-popover`, weaker/absent blur, `shadow-md`/`shadow-2xl`).
  The selectable rows in `Select`/`CustomSelect`/`Combobox` now use the shared
  `.dropdown-item` class — the same left accent bar on hover/selection as the
  language picker, replacing per-component check-mark / tinted-background styles.
  `.dropdown-item` was extended to also drive Radix rows (keyboard
  `data-highlighted`, selected `data-state=checked`), so hand-rolled and Radix
  dropdowns render identically.
- **Palette values are now original.** The scheme primitives are regenerated from
  the OKLCH model rather than the previously vendored ramps, so semantic-token
  consumers may see subtle color shifts. The generator and all values are first-party.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **Softer corner radii across the core surfaces.** Bumped the global component
  classes a notch rounder — `.btn` 12→14, `.btn-sm` 9→11, `.btn-lg` 14→16,
  `.card`/`.glass-card` 16→20, `.stat-card`/`.gradient-card`/`.glass-card-enhanced`
  20→24, `.input`/`.code-block` 12→14, `.badge` 6→8, `.nav-item`/`.nav-tab`/
  `.dropdown-item` 10→12. Literal px only — the Tailwind `--radius-*` namespace is
  deliberately untouched (defining it there hijacks every `rounded-*` utility).

### Fixed
- **True-black (OLED) surfaces are no longer invisible.** `--color-muted`/
  `--color-card` map to `--bg-elevated`/`--bg-card`, which true-black set to pure
  `#000` — so every `bg-muted`/`bg-card` fill (hover states, tiles, switch tracks,
  sticky headers, cards) vanished into the black page. Lifted elevated→`#141414`
  and card→`#0a0a0a` (page stays `#000`), so fills are visible while borders/rings
  still delineate.
- **`Switch` off-state is visible in true-black.** The unchecked track was
  `bg-transparent` with only a faint `--border-strong` outline (≈invisible on
  `#000`); it now carries a `bg-muted` fill so the track reads in every theme.
- **White ink on colored fills stays white in true-black.** Added `.text-pure-white`
  (immune to the true-black `.text-white`→`#d4d4d8` body-text dim) and used it for
  the `NotificationBell` count badge and `AvatarUploader` overlay icons, which were
  dropping to a low-contrast grey on their red / black fills.
- **`ConnectedAccountRow` provider badge sits on the avatar edge.** It was pinned
  to the bounding-box corner (`-bottom-1 -right-1`), floating off the circular
  avatar; now `bottom-0 right-0` so it overlaps the ring cleanly.
- **`ModelSelect` hover stutter (esp. Safari).** Each sticky group header added its
  own `backdrop-blur` on top of the panel's — 5 stacked `backdrop-filter` layers,
  which makes hover/scroll repaint janky. The header now uses a solid `bg-muted`
  fill (1 filter layer total).
- **`ModelSelect` provider group headers no longer render as a bright white box.**
  The sticky header laid its own `bg-popover/95` fill on top of the already
  translucent `bg-popover/90` panel, so the band stacked to a brighter/whiter
  surface — a hard square seam, very visible over a tinted page. It's now a
  rounded `rounded-xl` bar with a *muted* (not popover-white) fill that echoes
  the model rows — a deliberate on-brand label that still occludes scrolling
  rows, instead of a stray white box.
- **`ModelSelect` keyboard-highlight ring no longer sits on the top row by default.**
  The arrow-key highlight now starts at "no selection" (`-1`) instead of index `0`, so
  the white focus ring appears only once the user actually presses Up/Down — and clears
  on mouse move so it never competes with hover. `Enter` with nothing highlighted still
  picks the top result (classic combobox).
- **`Checkbox` no longer crashes when used uncontrolled.** `checked` now defaults
  to `false` and `onCheckedChange` is optional (guarded), so a display-only
  checkbox (no handler) renders instead of throwing on click.
- **`ModelManagerCard` no longer stretches to fit a long model name.** The name now
  carries `min-w-0 break-words`, so an unbreakable long name wraps inside the card
  instead of widening the whole column.
- **`.badge` is now an atomic unit.** Added `white-space: nowrap` + `flex-shrink: 0`
  so a badge keeps its icon and label on one line and wraps as a whole in a narrow
  flex column, instead of being squeezed until a CJK label breaks per-character.
- **`LanguageSwitcher` `pill` collapses to icon-only when space is tight.** The label
  is `hidden sm:inline` (icon + `aria-label` still convey the control), so the pill
  degrades to a round globe button on narrow widths instead of overflowing.

### Added
- **`SessionItem` (patterns)** — a row in an active-sessions / signed-in-devices
  list: device glyph, name with current / inactive badges, a `browser · OS` line,
  an IP + last-seen footer, and a revoke button. Host maps device→icon, formats
  the time, owns revoke.
- **`MetricBar` (patterns)** — a labelled row with a thin proportion bar for
  "top N" breakdowns (spend-by-provider, usage-by-category, storage-by-bucket):
  icon (or color dot) · label · right-aligned value · colored bar.
- **`InlineStatus` (primitive)** — a compact inline async-job status: a (spinning)
  icon plus a host-supplied label, or a percentage while running (`pending` /
  `processing` / `completed` / `failed`). Distinct from `StatusIndicator` (a
  presence dot) and `StatusBadge` (an approval pill).
- **`FeatureLockedState` (patterns)** — the centered "feature unavailable" screen
  (icon medallion · title · description · optional dashed restricted-note card),
  for rendering as a feature-flag fallback. Presentation only; the host gates.
- **`Banner` (patterns)** — a tinted, horizontal banner row (`info` / `warning` /
  `critical` / `success` / `neutral`) with an icon, title, inline description,
  meta, actions and an optional dismiss. One component for announcement, release
  and verification-style banners (distinct from the stacked `Alert` primitive).
- **`NotificationBell` / `NotificationItem` / `NotificationPanel` (patterns)** —
  presentational notification-center pieces: a bell trigger with an unread-count
  badge, a notification row (type-glyph slot · title · body · time, optional
  adapter-`Link` + hover dismiss), and the dropdown chrome (header, scrollable
  list with loading / empty states, footer slot). The host owns fetch / auth /
  polling / mark-as-read and the open state; copy is passed in.
- **`SimplePagination` (patterns)** — a prev / page-indicator / next pager for
  cursor- or has-more-style lists where the total page count isn't known (so
  `BlogPagination`'s numbered pages don't apply). Same ghost-button styling;
  `hasNext` drives the next button, `labels.page` renders the centre indicator.
- **`ModelManagerCard` (ai)** — a dense admin model row rendered as a card: header
  (select · icon · name + id chips · row actions), a 2-column labelled spec grid
  (provider, developer, type, status, context **or** resolution, max output, price
  in/out), and capability badges — every admin-table column present, top-to-bottom,
  so model management reads on any width instead of a wide scrolling table. All
  values are slots. Long, unbreakable names wrap inside the card.
- **`SettingRow` (patterns)** — one labelled row in a settings / preferences list:
  title · optional description · trailing control slot (a `Switch`, `Select`,
  button…). Stack several in a card; a bottom border divides them and the last
  one drops it. Presentation only — the host owns the control and its state.
- **`LinkRow` (patterns)** — a tappable row that links somewhere: leading icon ·
  title + description · trailing chevron. For support links, settings navigation,
  "manage X" entries. `external` opens a new-tab anchor; otherwise it routes
  through the adapter `Link`.
- **`ConnectedAccountRow` (patterns)** — a row in a connected-accounts /
  integrations list: a provider avatar (image, or a glyph in a ring) with a small
  provider badge overlay · name + optional sub-name · detail line · connected-time
  footer · unlink button. Host owns the unlink.
- **`AvatarUploader` (patterns)** — a clickable avatar that opens a file picker:
  shows the image or an initials fallback, a camera overlay on hover, and a spinner
  while uploading. `onSelectFile` hands back the chosen `File`; the host uploads.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **`ModelSelect` (ai)** — a generic, domain-agnostic searchable model picker:
  provider grouping, provider + capability filters, a pinned section, and a glassy
  dropdown. Consumers map their model type to `ModelSelectOption` (icon/badges/
  detail/meta are slots) and own pinning + filters via props — no app types,
  pricing or i18n leak into the design system. Selection uses YunUI's left-bar
  signature (a full bar when selected, a faint bar that slides in on hover, like
  the Sidebar). New exports: `ModelSelect`, `ModelSelectOption`,
  `ModelSelectFilter`, `ModelSelectLabels`.
- **`CapabilityIcon` (ai)** — the glyph-only capability indicator (the colored
  icon shown inline after a model name), built on the same shared capability
  config `CapabilitySelector` uses. Plus `isKnownCapability`. (The labelled pill
  `CapabilityBadge` already lived in `patterns`.) The capability config also
  gained `dark:` text variants, improving `CapabilitySelector` dark mode.
- **`StatCard` `compact` prop (patterns)** — the lighter `card p-4` tile for dense
  stat grids (keeps the dark-mode tone colors inline versions lacked).

### Changed
- **Unified glassy overlay surfaces** — `Dialog`, `Modal`, `DropdownMenu`, `Select`
  and `Sheet` now share the navbar's glassy treatment (`bg-…/90 backdrop-blur-xl`)
  instead of flat opaque slabs. `Sheet` is a floating, fully-rounded drawer.
- **Mobile-responsive layouts** — `PageHeader` / `MediaPageHeader` stack title and
  actions on small screens; `Grid` and `CapabilitySelector` ramp columns
  mobile-first; `Navbar`, `Footer`, `CodeBlock`, `Pagination` and `Table` were
  tightened for narrow viewports.

### Fixed
- **`<Table responsive>` no longer overflows on mobile.** The stacked card used a
  label-left / value-right row that pushed wide cell content (icons, badges, long
  names, action buttons) off the card and clipped it. Cells now stack
  label-above-value, full-width, so any content stays on-screen.
- **`azure` / `aws` / `bedrock` rendered GitHub's icon and the "GitHub Models"
  name** — a stale "served-via-GitHub-Models" shortcut. They now resolve to their
  own icon and proper display name.
- **`Pagination`** active-state and width on mobile (no stray overflow box on tap).

## [0.2.12] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **Brand icons now come from `@lobehub/icons-static-avatar` (MIT)** — the avatar
  variants (logo on a brand-colored rounded tile) instead of bare logos, so every
  provider/model icon reads as a consistent app-style tile in both light and dark
  (the previous bare SVGs looked "naked" on cards). `scripts/sync-icons.mjs` now
  vendors the FULL avatar set (309 brands) into `icons/providers/` and generates
  `PROVIDER_ICON_SLUGS`, so any brand Yunxin references (e.g. `opencode`, which was
  missing) resolves without a hand-maintained map entry. Mono-only / non-lobe
  brands keep their existing raster.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- **Provider/model icons resolved to the wrong extension after the 0.2.10 lobe sync.**
  The sync rewrote 43+ rasters to `.svg` but `providerIconMap`/`modelIconMap` still
  named the old `.png`/`.webp`, so those icons 404'd and fell back to initials.
  `scripts/sync-icons.mjs` now also rewrites the filename literals in the icon maps
  to match the files on disk (75 entries corrected).

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **Icon sync from `@lobehub/icons-static-svg` (MIT).** `scripts/sync-icons.mjs`
  pulls fresh brand-COLOR SVGs for providers/models/apps into `icons/`, so the
  set stops drifting — re-run `pnpm icons:sync` to refresh or add brands (alias
  map handles name differences; mono-only brands keep their raster to avoid the
  currentColor-in-dark-mode issue). 43 providers upgraded to vector this pass.
- **`<Table responsive>`** — dense, many-column tables stack each row into a
  labelled card below the `md` breakpoint instead of forcing a horizontal scroll,
  so they stay readable on narrow screens. Pair with **`<TableCell label="…">`**
  to label each value. (Wide screens render the normal table; pages should avoid
  forcing `whitespace-nowrap`/`min-width` on every column so it can fit the
  viewport.)
- `Checkbox` now accepts `checked="indeterminate"` (renders a dash) for partial
  select-all states.

### Changed
- **`Sheet` is now a general slide-in drawer**, shown on all screen sizes by
  default — it no longer hard-codes `lg:hidden`. Pass **`mobileOnly`** for the old
  hide-on-`lg`+ behavior (a drawer that only exists on mobile). Fixes the Sheet
  appearing to "not open" on desktop.

### Fixed
- **Safari rendering.** `PasswordInput`'s reveal toggle is now a flex child (it
  was absolutely positioned, which Safari pushed *outside* the field), and
  `NumberInput` hides the native number spinner via plain CSS in
  `styles/yunui.css` — the Tailwind `[&::-webkit-*]` arbitrary variants were
  ignored by Safari, so it showed a duplicate spinner next to the −/+ steppers.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `SearchInput` gains a **`size`** prop (`"sm" | "md"`, default `md`). `sm` is a
  compact 32px-tall variant for toolbars and dropdown filters (e.g. the model
  picker), keeping the same icon size so it reads as a smaller version, not a
  different control.
- `Combobox` gains **`creatableFilter`** (only offer the "create new" row for
  inputs passing a test) and **`creatableIcon`** (custom glyph for that row) — so
  consumers like Yunxin's icon-URL combobox can single-source from YunUI instead
  of forking the component.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **`.card-col` no longer sets `height: 100%`.** That explicit height overrode the
  grid's `align-items: stretch` and, when the grid's own height was indefinite
  (e.g. a centered flex container), collapsed each card to its content height — so
  the footer-pinning silently failed. Stretch alone is the robust path; footers now
  align in any grid context.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **`SearchInput`** — the canonical search field: a leading magnifier with the
  right padding (typed text never sits under the icon) plus an optional clear
  button. Uses `type="text"` + `role="searchbox"` so there's **no duplicate native
  ✕**, restores focus after clearing, and `onChange` returns the string directly.
  Replaces hand-rolled `<input> + absolute icon` search boxes.
- More common primitives: **`Separator`** (h/v divider), **`Alert`** (info/success/
  warning/error callout with icon + title), **`Tag`** (small, optionally removable
  label), and **`AvatarGroup`** (overlapping avatars with a "+N" overflow chip).
- Status & docs primitives: **`StatusIndicator`** (colored status dot + label,
  optional pulse), **`InlineCode`** (inline code span), and **`Steps`** (vertical
  progress stepper with done/active/upcoming states).
- **`.card-col` + `.card-footer`** CSS classes: lay a `.card` out as a column with
  its footer pinned to the bottom, so equal-height grid cards line their footers up
  regardless of body content. Single-sources the card-footer-alignment fix here
  (instead of per-consumer inline flex tweaks that keep regressing).

## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- New primitives closing part of the breadth gap: **`PasswordInput`**
  (masked field + show/hide reveal toggle), **`NumberInput`** (−/+ steppers with
  min/max clamping), and **`Kbd`** (inline keyboard-key display). All additive,
  same styling/error API as `Input`.
- `useFocusTrap(ref, enabled)` hook. **`Modal` (and `ConfirmModal`/`DeleteConfirmModal`/
  `RegenerateConfirmModal`, which build on it) now trap focus** — focus moves into
  the dialog on open, Tab/Shift+Tab cycle inside it, and focus returns to the
  opener on close. Closes the a11y gap flagged in 0.2.5.

### Fixed
- Showcase "Code" tabs now match the rendered preview (Button shows all 7 variants;
  Radix Select shows 3 items) and use the real `@yuhuanowo/yunui` import specifier
  (the in-repo `yunui` alias only resolves inside this repo).

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Broad opt-in brand theming.** With `data-accent-source="brand"` (+ `data-brand`)
  on `<html>` — or `applyTheme({ accentSource: "brand", brand: "blue" })` — the brand
  color now flows across the whole UI, not just a couple of buttons: primary/accent
  buttons, the `--color-primary` active/selected states (Switch, Checkbox,
  RadioGroup, selected combobox/select rows…), Slider range + thumb, Progress fill,
  focus rings (`--color-ring`), and the `bg-accent`/`text-accent` utilities. Body
  text stays on `--color-foreground`, so readability is untouched. **Default
  monochrome is byte-identical** (the markers/overrides do nothing without the
  attribute; verified visually with a violet brand across the showcase).
  Also covers active **navigation indicators** (sidebar nav-item bar, NavTabs
  underline, Navbar active-link underline + Sign-up CTA) and the **Radix Tabs**
  active pill (translucent brand tint).
  Brand buttons use a **translucent** brand tint (keeps YunUI's glassy feel, not
  heavy solid blocks) and **render correctly in dark mode** (the brand button
  overrides are placed after the `.dark .btn-*` rules so they win in both modes).
- A live **"Live brand theming" switcher** in the showcase (Mono/Brand + palette
  swatches) that dogfoods `useYunUITheme` and re-themes the whole page on click.

### Changed
- **"Which one do I use" guidance** on the overlapping component families, via
  JSDoc (visible in IDE + props tables), so picking one no longer feels like a
  trap: 3 dialogs (`Dialog` = accessible default / `Modal` = styled prop-driven /
  `ConfirmModal*` = confirmations) and 4 selects (`Select` / `CustomSelect` /
  `Combobox` / `SegmentedSelect`), plus `Tabs` vs `NavTabs`. Non-breaking.
- Corrected `Modal`'s docstring to state it does **not** trap focus (use `Dialog`
  when keyboard focus containment matters) — was previously implied "accessible".
- Demarcated `@yuhuanowo/yunui/ai` as the **app-domain layer** (AI-gateway
  components), not general-purpose primitives — so the core surface reads as a
  clean design system (core → `.`, patterns → `/patterns`, app domain → `/ai`).

### Internal
- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` + `actions/setup-node` to v5 (Node 24).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Opt-in brand accent** — bridge the legacy monochrome accent to the
  runtime token system. Set `data-accent-source="brand"` (+ `data-brand`) on
  `<html>`, or `applyTheme({ accentSource: "brand", brand: "blue" })`, to make
  accent-driven components (`.btn-accent`, `bg-accent`/`text-accent`, …) follow
  your brand color across every project. **Purely additive**: without the
  attribute the default monochrome look is byte-identical (verified by compiled
  CSS diff). New `YunUIAccentSource` type.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- Bundled icon set expanded to the **full shared asset library** sourced from
  Yunxin: `providers` (88), `models` (171), `apps` (55), `paintings` (7),
  `search` (5) — 326 files. YunUI is now the single source of truth for these
  icons; any project can pull them from the package or via jsDelivr
  (`…/@yuhuanowo/yunui@0.2/icons/<category>/<name>`), instead of keeping its own
  copy.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **AI icons are now bundled and served via CDN by default.** The package ships
  the provider/model icon set under `icons/`, and `iconBasePath` now defaults to
  jsDelivr (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@yuhuanowo/yunui@0.2/icons`) — so
  `ProviderIcon` / `ModelIcon` / `ModelCard` render with **zero setup**.
  - To self-host and extend with your own icons, copy the package's `icons/`
    into your app and set `iconBasePath` (e.g. `"/icons"`).
  - **Behavior change for self-hosting consumers** that relied on the old
    `/icons` default (e.g. Yunxin): set `iconBasePath: "/icons"` to keep using
    your own copy. `next/image` users: allow `cdn.jsdelivr.net` or self-host.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Runtime design-token system** (`styles/tokens.css`, generated by
  `scripts/gen-tokens.mjs`): a layered 3-tier system — 19 palettes × 12 steps →
  role map → semantic — switchable at runtime via `data-brand` / `data-accent` /
  `data-neutral` on `<html>`. Exposed as Tailwind utilities
  (`bg-brand-solid-strong`, `text-accent-on-background-weak`, …) and a JS API
  (`applyTheme`, `useYunUITheme`, `YUNUI_PALETTES`). **Additive** — the default
  look is unchanged.
- `Button` `variant="brand"` — solid fill driven by the themeable brand token.
- `Footer` is now also re-exported from `@yuhuanowo/yunui/patterns`.
- Docs demos have a single source of truth: `<ComponentPreview>` code tabs are
  auto-derived from the rendered children (remark plugin), so the shown code
  can't drift from the live preview.

### Fixed
- **Marquee** rendered as static text — added the missing
  `--animate-marquee(-vertical)` `@theme` tokens + keyframes.
- **Accessibility/correctness**: `Input`/`Textarea` set `aria-invalid` /
  `aria-describedby` + disabled styling; `IconButton` sets `aria-label`;
  `SegmentedSelect` buttons are `type="button"` + `aria-pressed`;
  `Switch`/`Checkbox` gained focus-visible rings.
- **Crash fix**: AI icon helpers (`ProviderIcon` / `ModelIcon` / `getIconPath` /
  `getProviderName`) no longer throw on an undefined provider id; tightened the
  fuzzy id matcher (no more `"ai"` → OpenAI false positives); `ProviderIcon`
  falls back gracefully when an icon asset 404s.
- Honest README: cross-project sync lands on the next `pnpm up`, not "instantly".

### Developer experience
- `pnpm dev` now runs the lib watch + site dev together (`concurrently`); added
  `pnpm tokens` to regenerate the token CSS.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Layout primitives** (the big layout-primitive gap): `Flex`, `Grid`, `Column`,
  `Row`, `Stack` — token-aware `gap`/`padding`/`align`/`justify`/`columns` via
  static class maps (Tailwind-compiler-safe).
- **`Accordion`** + **`RadioGroup`** (Radix-backed, full keyboard a11y).
- **Data display**: `Table` family (Table/Thead/Tbody/Tfoot/Tr/Th/Td + aliases),
  `Breadcrumb` family, controlled `Pagination` (ellipsis truncation, a11y labels).
- Tests for all of the above (141 total, up from 101).

### Fixed
- **`license` field corrected to `Apache-2.0`** to match the repo's LICENSE file.
  0.1.4–0.1.8 wrongly declared `MIT` in package metadata; this release fixes it.
- `CodeDemo` sample snippets use a generic `api.example.com` endpoint instead of
  a product-specific one.

## [0.1.8]

### Added
- JSDoc on ~150 public props + component descriptions across primitives,
  patterns, and ai entries — surfaces in editor IntelliSense (ships in `.d.ts`).
- Test suite expanded to 101 tests (from 21): interactive primitives (Switch,
  Checkbox, Slider, Tabs, Label), overlays/patterns (Modal, FAQ, Badge
  variants), and AI components (ModelCard, CapabilitySelector, IDBadge,
  ModelTypeIcon, Navbar, Footer). vitest setup stubs `ResizeObserver`.

### Changed
- `Button` variant aliases `default`/`red` documented as `@deprecated` (prefer
  `primary`/`destructive`); kept for backward compatibility.

## [0.1.7]

### Added
- `iconBasePath` adapter option — configure where `yunui/ai` icon assets are
  served (default `/icons`; point it at `/assets/icons`, a CDN origin, …).
  Resolves the out-of-box broken-image issue for non-default hosting. Custom
  `iconUrl` props still pass through untouched.
- `publint` packaging lint in CI + release.
- 3 tests for `ProviderIcon` icon-base resolution (21 tests total).

### Changed
- README icon caveat now documents the configurable `iconBasePath`.

## [0.1.6]

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` and a fuller README (install, Tailwind `@source`, adapters,
  exports, the AI icon-asset requirement, hooks, sync workflow).
- Test suite: vitest + Testing Library; 18 tests covering core primitives,
  `StatCard` variants, and `CustomSelect` keyboard/a11y.
- CI: `ci.yml` (typecheck + test + build + pack) and `release.yml`
  (tag `v*` → tokenless **OIDC trusted publishing** + provenance; no NPM_TOKEN).

### Changed
- `CustomSelect` is now an accessible combobox: ARIA roles
  (`combobox`/`listbox`/`option` + `aria-expanded`/`selected`/`activedescendant`)
  and full keyboard nav (↑/↓, Home/End, Enter, Escape, Tab) with
  highlight-into-view. Previously mouse-only.

### Fixed
- `site/` workspace dependency aliased to `@yuhuanowo/yunui` (broke after the
  package was scoped).

## [0.1.5]

### Added
- `yunui/ai`: `ModelTypeIcon`, `ProviderIconImg` (delegates to `ProviderIcon`),
  and `buttonVariants` (cva, for fumadocs-themed docs buttons).

### Notes
- `_deferred/ai-search` stays unexported — it is a full ai-sdk feature, not a
  reusable primitive, and would force `@ai-sdk/react` peer deps on the library.

## [0.1.4]

### Added
- Canonical `StatCard` with `tone` colors + `inline` and `valueFirst` layout
  variants (covers the dashboard / insights / analytics stat-card styles from
  one component).
- Built `dist/` is tracked in git so the package resolves over a git dependency
  without an install-time build.

### Changed
- `<Card>` now renders the `.card` utility class (matches the app-wide `.card`
  usages instead of bespoke inline classes).
- Package scoped to `@yuhuanowo/yunui` (the bare `yunui` name is blocked on npm).

## [0.1.0] – Initial extraction

- Yunxin's design system extracted into a standalone, versioned package:
  - `yunui` — atomic primitives (Button…DropdownMenu).
  - `yunui/css` — tokens, `@theme`, global classes, keyframes (3 themes).
  - `yunui/adapters` — `YunUIProvider`/`useYunUI` (Link/Image/router/i18n injection).
  - `yunui/patterns` — landing/blog/docs + layout components.
  - `yunui/ai` — Yunxin AI-domain components (prop-driven).
- tsup build → ESM + `.d.ts`, code-split shared adapter context, `"use client"`
  preserved, deps externalized at Yunxin's exact versions.
